## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the development and deployment of **time-series forecasting models** (ARIMA and Prophet) to predict weather patterns and enable **automated agricultural alerts**. Built using real-world data from the Michigan Automated Weather Network (MAWN), this system supports farmers in making critical decisions about crop planning, pest management, and resource allocation.

### Key Objectives

- Develop accurate time-series forecasting models for temperature, humidity, and precipitation
- Compare ARIMA, Prophet, and baseline models for agricultural forecasting
- Build an automated alert system for frost, heat stress, and disease risk
- Create an interactive dashboard for real-time monitoring and decision support

### Results Summary

| Model | Test MAE | Test RMSE | Status |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|
| **Prophet** | **3.56°C** | **4.61°C** | Best |
| ARIMA(5,1,3) | 12.18°C | 14.40°C | |
| Baseline | 12.09°C | 14.28°C | |

- **55 alerts generated** with an average lead time of **27 days**
- **Prophet model achieved 70% reduction in MAE** compared to baseline
- Successfully predicted **86% of frost events** in the test period

## Methodology

### 1. Data Preparation

**Data Source**: Michigan Automated Weather Network (MAWN) quality-controlled database

**Sampling Strategy**:
- Selected Aetna station for complete time-series continuity
- Aggregated hourly data to daily summaries (min, max, mean)
- Created 2,332 daily records spanning 6+ years
- Train/Validation/Test split: 74% / 16% / 10%

**Feature Engineering**:
- Growing Degree Days (GDD) with base 10°C
- Temperature range (daily max - min)
- Cumulative precipitation
- Leaf wetness duration

**Data Quality**:
- 99.96% completeness for key variables
- Quality flags: MAWN (validated), RTMA (estimated), EMPTY (missing)
- Forward-fill for small gaps (≤3 days)

### 2. Model Development

#### ARIMA Model
- **Stationarity Testing**: Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test
- **Parameter Selection**: Grid search over (p,d,q) combinations
- **Optimal Configuration**: ARIMA(5, 1, 3) based on AIC
- **Performance**: MAE = 12.18°C (struggled with seasonality)

#### Prophet Model
- **Seasonality**: Yearly and weekly patterns enabled
- **Trend**: Automatic changepoint detection
- **Uncertainty**: 95% confidence intervals
- **Performance**: MAE = 3.56°C (Best model)

#### Baseline (Persistence)
- Simple forecast: Tomorrow = Today
- Performance: MAE = 12.09°C
- Used to validate model improvements

### 3. Alert System

**Threshold-Based Rules**:
- Frost: Temp < 0°C → HIGH severity
- Heat: Temp > 30°C → MEDIUM severity
- Disease (High): Humidity > 90% AND Temp 15-25°C → HIGH severity
- Disease (Moderate): Humidity > 85% AND Temp 10-30°C → MEDIUM severity
- Heavy Rain: Precipitation > 25mm → HIGH severity

**Alert Generation**:
- Multi-variable forecasts (temperature, humidity, precipitation)
- Daily evaluation against thresholds
- Lead time calculation (days in advance)
- Actionable recommendations for each alert type

**Performance**:
- 55 alerts generated in test period (239 days)
- Average lead time: 27 days
- 86% detection rate for frost events

### 4. Model Evaluation

**Metrics**:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
- Residual analysis (distribution, autocorrelation)

**Validation Strategy**:
- Temporal train/validation/test split (no data leakage)
- Out-of-sample evaluation
- Comparison against baseline

## Key Findings

### Model Performance

1. **Prophet significantly outperformed ARIMA** for agricultural forecasting
 - 70% reduction in MAE compared to baseline
 - Better capture of seasonal patterns
 - More robust to long-term forecasts

2. **ARIMA limitations** for this use case
 - Struggled with strong seasonality
 - Required extensive parameter tuning
 - Less interpretable for stakeholders

3. **Practical implications**
 - Prophet is recommended for deployment
 - 3.56°C MAE is acceptable for agricultural decision-making
 - Confidence intervals provide risk assessment

### Alert System

1. **Frost warnings** were the most frequent alert type (55 alerts)
 - Critical for crop protection in Michigan climate
 - Average 27-day lead time enables proactive planning

2. **Disease risk alerts** require multi-variable monitoring
 - Humidity + temperature thresholds
 - Seasonal patterns (spring/fall higher risk)

3. **System reliability**
 - 86% detection rate for frost events
 - Low false negative rate (critical for agriculture)
 - Acceptable false positive rate (better safe than sorry)
